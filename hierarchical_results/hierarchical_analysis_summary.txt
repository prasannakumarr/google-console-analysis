HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY
==============================

INTRODUCTION
--------------------
This hierarchical analysis examines how SEO performance metrics vary
across different impression levels. By grouping keywords into Low, Mid,
and High impression categories, we can uncover patterns and insights
that would be missed in aggregate analysis.

------------------
Keywords were divided into three impression groups:
- Low: < 319.0 impressions
- Mid: 319.0 - 458.0 impressions
- High: > 458.0 impressions

   - Consider consolidating or expanding related content
   - May require different optimization strategies than high-volume keywords

4. GENERAL HIERARCHICAL STRATEGY:
   - Allocate resources proportionally to impression potential
   - Use different KPIs for different impression groups
   - Set group-specific performance targets
