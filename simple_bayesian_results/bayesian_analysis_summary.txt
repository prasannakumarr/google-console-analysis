SIMPLE BAYESIAN REGRESSION ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=======================================================

INTRODUCTION
--------------------
This simple Bayesian analysis provides probabilistic insights into the relationships
between SEO metrics using conjugate priors and empirical Bayes methods.
While not as sophisticated as full MCMC sampling, this approach gives us
probability distributions for coefficients and uncertainty quantification.

BAYESIAN REGRESSION RESULTS

PROBABILISTIC INSIGHTS
----------------------
Probability that Impressions coefficient is positive: 100.0%
Probability that CTR coefficient is positive: 100.0%
Probability that Position coefficient is positive: 89.1%

INTERPRETATION
------------
The Bayesian analysis provides probabilistic insights that complement our traditional regression:
- CTR has an extremely high probability (>99.9%) of positive impact on clicks
- Impressions also have a very high probability (>99.9%) of positive impact
- Position shows some probability of positive impact, but with more uncertainty
- The 95% credible intervals show the range of plausible values for each coefficient
- This approach quantifies uncertainty without requiring complex MCMC sampling

COMPARISON WITH TRADITIONAL REGRESSION
--------------------------------
While traditional regression gave us point estimates and p-values,
this Bayesian approach provides:
- Full probability distributions instead of single estimates
- Direct probability statements about parameter signs
- Credible intervals that quantify uncertainty
- More intuitive communication of results to stakeholders
- Works well with small datasets like ours (53 observations)

RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON BAYESIAN ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------
1. Focus on CTR optimization with high confidence (>99.9% probability of positive impact)
2. Increase impressions strategically (>99.9% probability of positive impact)
3. Monitor position but with awareness of higher uncertainty
4. Use the probability distributions for more accurate forecasting
5. Consider the credible intervals when setting performance targets
6. The high probabilities confirm that CTR and Impressions are robust drivers of clicks
